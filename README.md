# Proximity-Sensor
Industrial Proximity Sensor Project


This project demonstrates a low-level example of an ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) using Embedded C.

Developed without high-level Arduino libraries.

Utilizes direct Register Manipulation for hardware control.

Focuses on precise timing for industrial sensor logic.
